# Screen-Message
A tool to display text really big on your screen. I made it in high school so i sould talk in class without making noise, and so I could make slides on the fly in youth group without fumbling around with software, just open and type.

This tool is a modification of https://sm.nomeata.de/ by [Joachim Brietner](https://github.com/nomeata).  
It has multiple styles of text, some easter eggs, and many improvements over the original code. (decimal scaling, performance improvements, and some code to make sure things load) I'm also pretty sure that it's been updated to normal web standards of 2022 (no \<center\>.. etc)
